## Necessary Features

* Upload background image, from file system or as URL.

* Persist everything.
* Save/Restore persisted data as JSON, with optional compression to Base64.
* More built-in fonts.
  Outline fonts: [urbanfonts.com](https://www.urbanfonts.com/fonts/outline-fonts.htm),
  [Google (3 hits)](https://fonts.google.com/?query=outline),
  [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=fonts+with+outlines).
** "You can fake outlines using 4 duplicates of the same text with a different
   color, offset by n pixels in all directions, placed under the main text."

* Edit available fonts, in case you don't want all the supplied ones.
* Allow import of Google fonts, and maybe some other repositories.

## Nice Features
