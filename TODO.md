# TODO

This file tracks bugs and ideas for new features.

## Necessary Features

* Persist everything.
  Named memes.
  Named images.
  Unnamed images.
  Save / Use / Delete
* Save/Restore persisted data as JSON, with optional compression to Base64.
* Word-wrap outline font SVG.
* More built-in fonts.
* Edit available fonts, in case you don't want all the supplied ones.
* Allow import of Google fonts, and maybe some other repositories.

## Nice Features

* Space above first line of caption text.
  Not useful for bottom positions, but desirable for top and middle.
* Blank space above and/or below image. Specify color or background image.
* Markdown text.
* Resize handles on caption borders.
* Custom caption location, not just the nine current positions.
* Stamps and ornaments, e.g. speech bubbles.
